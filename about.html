            <h2>Who am I</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Pramod Yadav and I am a freelance Test Automation Expert (ZZP).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <i>Power Tester</i> is my one man software testing company. I have a little over 20 years of experience in building end to end test automation solutions for both enterprise and startups customers. Some of my well know startup customers were Mercell, Felyx and ClipBoardHealth. Some of the enterprise customers include ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank, European Patent Office and Atradius. 
            </p>

            <h2>Skills and experience</h2>
            <h3>Test Automation</h3>
            <p>
                I love to work with latest tech and tools and have experience automating both frontend (monolith, micro-frontend web and mobile), backend (microservices Rest and Soap) and databases (both SQL and noSQL databases).
            </p>
            <h3>Test integration with CICD</h3>
            <p> 
                I also have solid experience working with DevOps tools such as Azure Devops, GitHub actions and Jenkins and have used them to integrate tests closely in CICD pipelines. 
            </p>
            <h3>Test Monitoring</h3>
            <p>  
                For monitoring test results, I have experience using tools like ElasticSearch, Kibana, DataDog and BrowserStack Test Monitoring.
            </p>
            <h3>Test Tools</h3>
            <p>  
                After experimenting with a ton of tools for automation (frontend and backend), my tool of choice are now Playwright (with TypeScrpit) for web automation and RestAssured (with Java) for API automation. I have extensive experience working with Selenium (Java) and Appium (Java) as well. For API exploratory testing I have used both Postman and SoapUI extensively. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: rgb(8, 0, 255); font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>Although for Mobile automation, I would prefer to explore other tools like Espresso and XCUITest, which work better with source code and are more robust than Appium.
            </p>

            <h2>Leadership style</h2>

            <p>
                Apart from being a very hands on guy, I have solid experience leading, mentoring and scaling small and big test
                automation projects and teams, creating test strategies, and putting them into action.

            </p>
            <p>
                My unique experience in both technology and management, allows me to operate at highest levels, both as a leader and as
                an individual contributor. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                My team see me as a natural leader, mentor, continuous learner and a team player that they
                love to work with.
            </p>
            <h2>Motto: Learn, share, have fun!</h2>
            <p>
                I love to learn new tools and technologies and share what I have learned with others via my

                 and open source

                automation respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also created and published a few useful GitHub actions on GitHub Marketplace that QA community can use to accelarate testing. 
                For reference:

                        target="_blank">dynamic sharder</a>
                    github action would do dynamic scaling of github runners based on the changed test files in a pull request.</li>

                    will do dynamic scaling of github runners based on tests to run.

                            target="_blank">dynamic sharder</a>
                         github action would provide the quality gate result of BrowserStack Quality Gate API - a powerful API that help deal with flaky and failing tests better.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                At times, I also create hobby projects just for fun.     
            </p>
            <p>    
                For example, I once thought of finding out how frequently I call
                my friends and family. I parsed my monthly PDF phone statements using PowerShell and integrated It with Google Contacts
                to create a list of names-with-frequency report.
